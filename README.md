# 🚦 AI-Powered Traffic Management for a Safer, Smarter NYC 🌍

## **📌 Project Overview**
Traffic congestion significantly contributes to **carbon emissions** and urban pollution. This project leverages **machine learning** to optimize **traffic flow**, enhance **public safety** reduce **congestion**, and **lower emissions** by analyzing real-time traffic data, predicting congestion patterns, and implementing AI-driven traffic signal optimization.

## **🎯 Objectives**
✔️ **Predict** traffic congestion using historical and real-time data to forecast congestion patterns.  
✔️ **Optimize** traffic light timing with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to dynamically adjust traffic signal timing based on real-time conditions.  
✔️ **Suggest eco-friendly routes** : Provide drivers with route options that minimize emissions and fuel consumption. 
✔️ **Integrate** carbon footprint analytics for city planners : Develop tools for city planners to analyze the environmental impact of traffic management strategies.
