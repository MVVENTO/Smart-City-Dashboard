# Smart City Dashboard with Accessibility Features

## Overview

The **Smart City Dashboard** is an interactive web application that visualizes key city data in real-time. It provides insights into **traffic conditions**, **air quality**, and **public transit efficiency**. Additionally, it features **accessibility information** such as elevator availability and wheelchair access at public places. This project leverages **machine learning**, **real-time data integration**, and **data visualization** techniques to provide a comprehensive view of a city's operational efficiency and inclusivity.

## Key Features

- **Traffic Data**: Real-time traffic status and forecasting using historical data.
- **Air Quality**: Displays current air quality levels based on the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Public Transit**: Live public transportation data from city transit APIs.
- **Accessibility**: Real-time information on accessible locations such as elevators and wheelchair access in public buildings.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Traffic forecasting using regression models or time-series forecasting techniques.
